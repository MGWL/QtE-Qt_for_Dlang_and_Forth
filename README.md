QtE
===

Qt gui library for Dlang (dmd D2).

Qt wrapper for the D language (dmd D2 dlang) and Forth (SPF-4.20) language.

This works in Windows 32 and Linux 32 / 64 

This is a small study library to work with Qt. It uses dynamic linking and easy to use. 
It works on Windows and Linux. The way it works is simple: through the modules 
QtE.d (D) or QtE.f (Forth), take all necessary methods and properties of Qt, references to objects 
created using QtE.DLL(so) in C++. This method allows reducing programming in C++ to a minimum, 
making the QtE library.
